# Hoot-Scheduler
A .NET WinForms application for scheduling audio events - school project, 2010

This was a school project from 2010

Compiles the schedule into an XML bundle to pass to a cross-platform Java-based audio processor (hootd)

One unique feature is the ability for this application to schedule the system to wake just before an event. 

This was a requirement of the application to allow the system to enter sleep for extended periods before an event fires.
